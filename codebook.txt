Feature Selection (Updated for Coursera assignment)
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAccelerometer-XYZ and TimeGyroscope-XYZ. These Time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote Time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (TimeBodyAccelerometer-XYZ and TimeGravityAccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in Time to obtain Jerk signals (TimeBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ and TimeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (TimeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude, TimeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, TimeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, TimeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, TimeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FrequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ, FrequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, FrequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, FrequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

Mean(): Mean value
StDev(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
TimeBodyAccelerometerMean
TimeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean
TimeBodyGyroscopeMean
TimeBodyGyroscopeJerkMean

groupedData was obtained by computing the means for each subject and each activity (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)
